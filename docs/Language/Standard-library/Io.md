# std.io

Writing and buffered reading ([[MYLA-78]]).

```myla
from std.io import println, eprintln, write

fun main() {
    println("to stdout")
    eprintln("to stderr")
    write(1, "no newline\n")
}
// output:
// to stdout
// no newline
```

| Function | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `write(fd: int32, s: str) -> Result<(), IoError>` | Writes the bytes of `s` to file descriptor `fd`, all of them, or the error that stopped it (D146); a pipe nobody reads any more is `BrokenPipe` |
| `println(s)` | `s` and a newline to stdout |
| `eprint(s)`, `eprintln(s)` | To stderr, without / with a newline |

Output isn't buffered: what a program wrote is out before it waits for input.

A write to the standard output or error whose pipe nobody reads any more (`myla run prog.my | head -1`) ends the program quietly, as Unix tools stop: natively by SIGPIPE, on wasm32 with the exit code 141 a shell shows for it (D146). Any other error of `print`, `println`, `eprint` and `eprintln`, which have no result (a full disk: `prog > /dev/full`), ends the program with `runtime error: write failed: <cause>` and status 1 (D153); `write` gives it to the program. A write to any other descriptor gives the error to the program instead: the runtime ignores SIGPIPE, and gives a child it starts the default back.

## Reading

Reading goes through a buffered `Reader` ([[MYLA-78]]). Keep it in a `var`, or in a field of a struct whose `var self` methods read from it (Myla has no references, so a function can't take a reader to read from). A read blocks until there is input or the input ends; the bytes come back verbatim, and an error is the errno as an `IoError` from `std.fs`.

| Item | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `stdin() -> Reader` | A reader of the standard input |
| `reader(fd: int32) -> Reader` | A reader of file descriptor `fd` |
| `r.read_line() -> Result<Option<str>, IoError>` | The next line without its `"\n"` (a `"\r"` before it stays); a last line without `"\n"` counts; `None` at the end |
| `r.read_exact(n: int32) -> Result<Option<str>, IoError>` | Exactly the next `n` bytes (`""` for `n <= 0`); `None` if the input ends first (those bytes stay unread) |
| `r.read_to_end() -> Result<str, IoError>` | The rest of the input (`""` once it has ended) |
| `r.ready(timeout_ms: int32) -> bool` | Whether a read won't block: bytes are buffered, or within `timeout_ms` milliseconds input arrives, the input ends or reading fails (0: don't wait; negative: wait as long as it takes) |

```myla
from std.io import stdin, println

fun main() {
    var input = stdin()
    var n = 0
    while true {
        match input.read_line() {
            Ok(Some(line)) => {
                n = n + 1
                println(format("{}: {}", n, line))
            },
            Ok(None) => { break },
            Err(e) => { break },
        }
    }
}
```

A protocol that frames messages with a `Content-Length` header reads the header lines with `read_line` and the body with `read_exact`; `tests/burn/test_stdin.py` has an example.

In a task, each read has an async version that waits for the input with the task suspended, so the other tasks run meanwhile (D124, [[MYLA-230]]): `await r.read_line_async()`, `await r.read_exact_async(n)`, `await r.read_to_end_async()`, `await r.fill_async(want)`. They give what the blocking reads give; outside a task they block as those do. A task asked to stop (`task.cancel`, a `task.timeout` that ran out) stops waiting at once and gets `Err(IoError.Cancelled)` (ECANCELED). Natively the executor's poller watches the descriptor (a regular file, which it can't watch, is always ready); the interpreter looks at the waiting tasks' descriptors before each turn.
